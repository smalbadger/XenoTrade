# GUI Resource Files

This folder contains 2 other folders - 'designer' and 'compiled'. 

The files in the 'designer' folder are generated by the Qt 5 Designer application. Each of these files are .ui files that contain xml code.

The files in the 'compiled' folder are generated by pyuic (Python User Interface Compiler). These files should not be edited, but may be subclassed by the widget classes made in the xGUI directory.

To convert all files in the 'designer' directory to python code in the 'compiled' directory, simply run the python file COMPILE.py
