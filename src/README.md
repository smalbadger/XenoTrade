# In-Depth Description of System Architecture

# To-Do's
* Create an "updatable" abstract class or class template to standardize the way widgets are updated.
* In the Task Manager class, record the history of the size of the work queues along with how long each task takes. It would be useful to show this information in a widget and allow the user to change parameters such as the number of threads running.
* Create a queue of updatables and assign a thread that simply loops to update each object.
* Clean up existing code - make everything standardized and modular
* make templates for stuff.
* make a nice loading screen animation with OpenGL
* Figure out how to make separate packages or something so files can be divided up logically.
* write some nice documentation
